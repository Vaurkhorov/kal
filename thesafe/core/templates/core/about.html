        <div > Our idea is to develop a website to help people select their daily food items keeping a check on the ingredients they are allergic to so that they can enjoy their food without any risk to their health. Whenever the user craves for any food item,  he/she  will input that particular item in our website. We will provide him/her a list of all possible ingredients in that food item along with a checkbox of common allergens. Now, if the user is found allergic to an ingredient found in that food item comprising other 4-5 ingredients, we will provide a recommended list of food items with similar ingredients which the user is not allergic to.  Along with the recommended list we will provide user links of that food item availaible on some food chains such as Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon Pantry so that the user can have hassle-free experience. Along with the above details we will also provide user with recipees of some food items so that in case if the user wants to try homemade food he/she can get help for that too. </div>
        
        
        
        USP of our product-Our website will recommend food items taking in account the ingredients our user is allergic to and not like the usual search history recommendation.
        We will also provide the recipes and links to buy them from some popular food chains all at a single place.      
        
        
        Challenges that weâ€™ll face- At initial level, our biggest challenge is to find a large pool of data set of all the food items along with the ingredients and recipes involved so that our app can comprise of a wide variety of food items for the user to choose from and further user can have a rich experience.
